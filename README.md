## 0cean Space team in NASA INTERNATIONAL SPACE APPS CHALLENGE 2022
### HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY
0cean Space is a game that helps people to get familiar with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In our game, players will control the James Webb Space Telescope to rotate. Players also have to capture images that are all based on original images. Eventually, players will realize what the James Webb Space Telescope has discovered while having fun with this game alone or with friends. 0cean Space brings an entertaining experience that will arouse people's interest in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).

### What exactly does it do? How does it work?
Initially, players will have to control the James Webb Space Telescope to rotate. Titles of images, scores, and tips can be found at the bottom.
The player's goal is to spin the James Webb Space Telescope and control it to face the images.
This simulates the James Webb Space Telescope when it captures images.

By pressing A or D, the James Webb Space Telescope will spin up or spin down 45 degrees.

Once the players capture the target image, the scores will increase.
Additionally, the next target image will be displayed on the window.

After completing all 12 images, players will see a congratulatory window, listing 0cean Space crews and our adorable cats.
Congrats!
Press Q to exit 0cean Space.


### What benefits does it have?
With 0cean Space, players can get familiar with the James Webb Space Telescope by giving a brief glimpse into Webb’s images. During the gaming process, the strength of Webb can be seen and it highlights Webb's functionality. People will learn more about the value of space observing, and this will motivate their imaginations. Eventually, they will be fascinated by the James Webb Space Telescope.

### What do you hope to achieve?
Ultimately, we hope to design a game that people of all ages will understand more about the James Webb Space Telescope, and how essential the James Webb Space Telescope has brought to space exploration. Moreover, a game is more interesting instead of a tedious article and easier to draw everyone’s attention. We believe that 0cean Space is essential since it brings an amusing experience that will arouse people's interest in the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).
